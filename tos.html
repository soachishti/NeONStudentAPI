    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>To keep your session live we send a "token" in url request to keep session secure and to serve the requests. 
			<br> After completing request this app (locally on your device) keep the result (your information) to speed up the experience and to support offline usage.
			<br> You can delete the data by going to Menu -&gt; Setting -&gt; Clear History and Log Out
			<br>

		<p>
			We don't save password on API Server we delete it after logging in to NeON. For detail review routes/login.js in source code (line no ~64). For further request to NeON we keep NeON's session id on API server and these details are encrypted using AES 256 for detail review db.js in source code (line no ~45, ~62 and ~81)
